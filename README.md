This mod adds info about what mods have updated since you last saved your game.
If any of the active mods have changed you can show a list of these with convenient links to the Steam, changelog or any other defined link of the mod.

This was made to make it easier to locate what mods have changed, for example when trying to find out what mod has started causing an issue.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
